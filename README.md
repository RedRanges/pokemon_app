An app that shows the different strengths and weaknesses of generation one Pokemon by visualizing their stats.

### Installing
You will need to deploy a local server that can render the index.html page. Python 3 makes it easy to serve html files on a local server. Download python 3 at https://www.python.org/ 

Once you have Python 3 installed you can spin up a server by doing the following:
Navigate to directory that contains the index.html file in your terminal and type in:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

Then go to your web browser and type in: Localhost:8000
